unknown night journey  carriage went   hard pace straight along

quite manageable again though  still trembled  driver again
took  seat  shaking  reins started    great pace 
time  going   far side   Pass  suddenly turned down 
narrow roadway  ran sharply   right

Soon   hemmed   trees   places arched right over 
roadway till  passed  through  tunnel  again great frowning
rocks guarded  boldly   side Though    shelter 
 hear  rising wind   moaned  whistled through 
rocks   branches   trees crashed together   swept along
 grew colder  colder still  fine powdery snow began  fall
  soon    around   covered   white blanket 
keen wind still carried  howling   dogs though  grew
fainter   went   way  baying   wolves sounded nearer
 nearer  though   closing round     side 
grew dreadfully afraid   horses shared  fear  driver
      disturbed  kept turning  head 
left  right     see anything through  darkness

Suddenly away   left  saw  faint flickering blue flame 
driver saw    same moment   once checked  horses 
jumping   ground disappeared   darkness    know
    less   howling   wolves grew closer  
 wondered  driver suddenly appeared again  without  word took
 seat   resumed  journey  think    fallen asleep
 kept dreaming   incident   seemed   repeated
endlessly  now looking back     sort  awful nightmare
Once  flame appeared  near  road  even   darkness
around    watch  drivers motions  went rapidly  
 blue flame aroseit    very faint     seem
 illumine  place around   alland gathering  few stones
formed    device Once  appeared  strange optical

  effect   momentary  took    eyes deceived 
straining through  darkness    time    blue
flames   sped onwards through  gloom   howling  
wolves around   though   following   moving circle

 last  came  time   driver went further afield  
  gone  during  absence  horses began  tremble worse
    snort  scream  fright    see  cause
    howling   wolves  ceased altogether  
  moon sailing through  black clouds appeared behind 
jagged crest   beetling pineclad rock    light  saw
around   ring  wolves  white teeth  lolling red tongues
 long sinewy limbs  shaggy hair    hundred times more
terrible   grim silence  held   even   howled
 myself  felt  sort  paralysis  fear      man
feels himself face  face  such horrors    understand
 true import

  once  wolves began  howl  though  moonlight

looked helplessly round  eyes  rolled   way painful  see

   see again  driver  climbing   calèche

dreadful fear came upon     afraid  speak  move  time
seemed interminable   swept   way now   complete
darkness   rolling clouds obscured  moon  kept 
ascending  occasional periods  quick descent    main
always ascending Suddenly  became conscious   fact

 JuneThis morning    sitting   edge   bed
cudgelling  brains  heard without  cracking  whips  pounding
 scraping  horses feet up  rocky path beyond  courtyard
 joy  hurried   window  saw drive   yard two great
leiterwagons each drawn  eight sturdy horses    head 
each pair  Slovak   wide hat great nailstudded belt dirty

 June before morningLast night  Count left  early 
locked himself    room  soon   dared  ran up 
winding stair  looked out   window  opened south 
thought   watch   Count    something going 
 Szgany  quartered somewhere   castle   doing work 
 kind  know   now    hear  faraway muffled sound
  mattock  spade  whatever       end  
ruthless villainy

     window somewhat less  half  hour   saw
something coming out   Counts window  drew back  watched
carefully  saw  whole man emerge    new shock   
find      suit  clothes    worn whilst
travelling here  slung over  shoulder  terrible bag  
 seen  women take away     doubt    quest
   garb      new scheme  evil   
allow others  see    think     both leave
evidence     seen   towns  villages posting  
letters    wickedness     shall   local
people  attributed  

 makes  rage  think    go   whilst   shut up
here  veritable prisoner  without  protection   law 
 even  criminals right  consolation

 thought   watch   Counts return    long time sat
doggedly   window   began  notice    
quaint little specks floating   rays   moonlight  
  tiniest grains  dust   whirled round  gathered 
clusters   nebulous sort  way  watched    sense 
soothing   sort  calm stole over   leaned back  
embrasure   more comfortable position     enjoy more
fully  ërial gambolling

Something made  start up  low piteous howling  dogs somewhere far
below   valley   hidden   sight Louder  seemed 
ring   ears   floating motes  dust  take new shapes 
 sound   danced   moonlight  felt myself struggling 
awake   call   instincts nay  very soul  struggling
  halfremembered sensibilities  striving  answer  call 
 becoming hypnotised Quicker  quicker danced  dust 
moonbeams seemed  quiver   went     mass  gloom
beyond More  more  gathered till  seemed  take dim phantom
shapes    started broad awake   full possession  
senses  ran screaming   place  phantom shapes  
becoming gradually materialised   moonbeams  those  
three ghostly women     doomed  fled  felt somewhat
safer    room     moonlight    lamp
 burning brightly

  couple  hours  passed  heard something stirring  
Counts room something   sharp wail quickly suppressed  
  silence deep awful silence  chilled   
beating heart  tried  door    locked   prison 
  nothing  sat down  simply cried

  sat  heard  sound   courtyard withoutthe agonised cry  
woman  rushed   window  throwing  up peered out between
 bars  indeed   woman  dishevelled hair holding 
hands over  heart  one distressed  running   leaning
against  corner   gateway   saw  face   window 
threw herself forward  shouted   voice laden  menace

Monster give   child

 threw herself   knees  raising up  hands cried  same
words  tones  wrung  heart   tore  hair  beat 
breast  abandoned herself    violences  extravagant
emotion Finally  threw herself forward  though    see
   hear  beating   naked hands against  door

Somewhere high overhead probably   tower  heard  voice  
Count calling   harsh metallic whisper  call seemed  
answered  far  wide   howling  wolves Before many minutes
 passed  pack   poured   pentup dam  liberated
through  wide entrance   courtyard

   cry   woman   howling   wolves  
short Before long  streamed away singly licking  lips

   pity    knew now   become   child

   first time   life  saw Van Helsing break down

gums drawn back   teeth  thus looked positively longer 
sharper  usual   woke  softness   eyes evidently
changed  expression   looked   self although  dying
one   afternoon  asked  Arthur   telegraphed

 shortened Arthurs presence  seemed  act  
stimulant  rallied  little  spoke   more brightly  
 done   arrived   pulled himself together  spoke 
cheerily       best  made  everything

Come   drawingroom     big fire    two
sofas  shall lie  one        sympathy 
 comfort  each  even though    speak  even  
sleep Arthur went    casting back  longing look  Lucys
face  lay   pillow  whiter   lawn  lay
quite still   looked round  room  see     
    see   Professor  carried out   room
     purpose  using  garlic  whole  
windowsashes reeked    round Lucys neck over  silk
handkerchief  Van Helsing made  keep    rough chaplet 
 same odorous flowers Lucy  breathing somewhat stertorously 
 face    worst   open mouth showed  pale gums 
teeth   dim uncertain light seemed longer  sharper  
    morning  particular   trick   light 
canine teeth looked longer  sharper   rest  sat down  
 presently  moved uneasily   same moment  came  sort
 dull flapping  buffeting   window  went over   softly
 peeped out   corner   blind    full moonlight
   see   noise  made   great bat  wheeled
rounddoubtless attracted   light although  dimand  now
 again struck  window   wings   came back   seat
 found  Lucy  moved slightly   torn away  garlic
flowers   throat  replaced   well     sat
watching 

Presently  woke   gave  food  Van Helsing  prescribed
 took   little   languidly    seem   
 now  unconscious struggle  life  strength   hitherto
 marked  illness  struck   curious   moment 
became conscious  pressed  garlic flowers close    
certainly odd  whenever     lethargic state  
stertorous breathing  put  flowers      
waked  clutched  close    possibility  making 
mistake      long hours  followed   many
spells  sleeping  waking  repeated both actions many times

 six oclock Van Helsing came  relieve  Arthur   fallen
  doze   mercifully   sleep    saw Lucys face
  hear  sissing indraw   breath       
sharp whisper Draw up  blind  want light   bent down
   face  touching Lucys examined  carefully 
removed  flowers  lifted  silk handkerchief   throat 
    started back    hear  ejaculation Mein
Gott    smothered   throat  bent over  looked 
   noticed  queer chill came over 

 wounds   throat  absolutely disappeared

 fully five minutes Van Helsing stood looking     face
  sternest   turned     calmly

  dying     long now    much difference mark
 whether  dies conscious    sleep Wake  poor boy 
  come  see  last  trusts     promised 

 went   diningroom  waked    dazed   moment 
  saw  sunlight streaming  through  edges   shutters
 thought   late  expressed  fear  assured   Lucy
 still asleep  told   gently     both Van
Helsing   feared   end  near  covered  face  
hands  slid down   knees   sofa   remained
perhaps  minute   head buried praying whilst  shoulders
shook  grief  took    hand  raised  up Come 
   old fellow summon   fortitude    best
 easiest  

  came  Lucys room   see  Van Helsing  
 usual forethought  putting matters straight  making
everything look  pleasing  possible   even brushed Lucys
hair    lay   pillow   usual sunny ripples  
came   room  opened  eyes  seeing  whispered
softly

Arthur Oh  love    glad   come   stooping 
kiss   Van Helsing motioned  back   whispered 
 Hold  hand   comfort  more

 Arthur took  hand  knelt beside    looked  best
   soft lines matching  angelic beauty   eyes 
gradually  eyes closed   sank  sleep   little bit 
breast heaved softly   breath came  went   tired childs

  insensibly  came  strange change    noticed 
 night  breathing grew stertorous  mouth opened   pale
gums drawn back made  teeth look longer  sharper    
sort  sleepwaking vague unconscious way  opened  eyes 
 now dull  hard  once     soft voluptuous voice
such    never heard   lips

Arthur Oh  love    glad   come Kiss  Arthur bent
eagerly over  kiss     instant Van Helsing   
  startled   voice swooped upon   catching  
 neck  both hands dragged  back   fury  strength 
 never thought    possessed  actually hurled  
  room

   life      living soul   
 stood between    lion  bay

Arthur   taken aback       moment know   
   before  impulse  violence  seize   realised
 place   occasion  stood silent waiting

 kept  eyes fixed  Lucy   Van Helsing   saw  spasm 
 rage flit   shadow over  face  sharp teeth champed
together   eyes closed   breathed heavily

Van Helsing forced back  leaden flange    looked  
recoiled

Quincey Morris

Professor  answered    word    want  wouldnt ask

woeful presage through  night

   long spell  silence  big aching void    
Professor  keen Ssss  pointed  far down  avenue  yews

Dr Seward tried one  two skeleton keys  mechanical dexterity

regarding  purchase   little trouble  found  key

   opening  door  faint malodorous air seemed  exhale
through  gaps  none    expected such  odour  
encountered None   others  met  Count    close
quarters     seen       fasting stage 
 existence   rooms     gloated  fresh blood

Under ordinary circumstances such  stench   brought 
enterprise   end     ordinary case   high

above merely physical considerations   involuntary shrinking
consequent   first nauseous whiff  one   set

 seeing Lord Godalming suddenly turn  look out   vaulted

heart stood still Somewhere looking out   shadow  seemed 
see  high lights   Counts evil face  ridge   nose

 few minutes later  saw Morris step suddenly back   corner 
  examining   followed  movements   eyes 
undoubtedly  nervousness  growing     saw  whole mass
 phosphorescence  twinkled  stars   instinctively drew
back  whole place  becoming alive  rats

  moment  two  stood appalled  save Lord Godalming  
seemingly prepared  such  emergency Rushing over   great
ironbound oaken door  Dr Seward  described   outside
    seen myself  turned  key   lock drew 
huge bolts  swung  door open  taking  little silver
whistle   pocket  blew  low shrill call   answered
 behind Dr Sewards house   yelping  dogs

Unconsciously    moved towards  door    moved

multiplying  thousands   moved out

Lord Godalming lifted one   dogs  carrying   placed

 dogs frisked   barked merrily   made sudden darts

Whether    purifying   deadly atmosphere   opening

Last night  went  bed   men  gone simply   told

 cant quite remember   fell asleep last night  remember hearing
 sudden barking   dogs   lot  queer sounds  praying
  very tumultuous scale  Mr Renfields room   somewhere
under      silence over everything silence 
profound   startled     up  looked out   window
  dark  silent  black shadows thrown   moonlight
seeming full   silent mystery      thing seemed  
stirring     grim  fixed  death  fate    thin

 done  good     back  bed  found  lethargy
creeping over   lay      quite sleep    out
 looked out   window again  mist  spreading   now
close up   house     see  lying thick against

attendants  dealing      frightened   crept 
bed  pulled  clothes over  head putting  fingers   ears
     bit sleepy     thought    
fallen asleep  except dreams    remember anything until 
morning  Jonathan woke   think   took   effort  
little time  realise        Jonathan  
bending over   dream  very peculiar    typical

waterpouring   through  window  through  joinings

Church Suddenly  horror burst upon     thus  Jonathan
 seen those awful women growing  reality through  whirling mist

careful  such dreams    unseat ones reason

Dr Seward    very considerate towards  Believe

interviewer calls  story  one      proper order
Here  

  mention drinking

Fears  thought  being burdened   soul  anything

  dread  wanting life   future

Despises  meaner forms  life altogether though  dreads being

 once   sat around  table  eyes opened  wonder whether
 whole   past days     dream     
caught sight   red blotch  Mrs Harkers forehead   
brought back  reality Even now    gravely revolving 
matter    impossible  realise   cause   
trouble  still existent Even Mrs Harker seems  lose sight  
trouble  whole spells    now  again  something
recalls    mind   thinks   terrible scar   
meet here   study  half  hour  decide   course 
action  see  one immediate difficulty  know   instinct
  reason  shall    speak frankly    fear
   mysterious way poor Mrs Harkers tongue  tied  know
  forms conclusions           
guess  brilliant   true        
 give  utterance   mentioned   Van Helsing 
     talk  over    alone  suppose    
 horrid poison      veins beginning  work 
Count    purposes   gave   Van Helsing called 
Vampires baptism  blood Well     poison  distils

Van Helsing  coming   study  little before  others  shall
try  open  subject  

                                   

LaterWhen  Professor came   talked over  state 
things   see    something   mind   wanted 
  felt  hesitancy  broaching  subject  beating
  bush  little   suddenly

Friend John   something      talk  alone 
  first   rate Later     take  others  
confidence   stopped   waited  went 

Madam Mina  poor  Madam Mina  changing  cold shiver ran
through   find  worst fears thus endorsed Van Helsing
continued

  sad experience  Miss Lucy    time  warned
before things go  far  task  now  reality more difficult 
   new trouble makes  hour   direst importance

LaterAt  very outset   meeting  great personal relief 
experienced  both Van Helsing  myself Mrs Harker  sent 
message   husband       join   present 
 thought  better     free  discuss  movements
without  presence  embarrass   Professor   looked  each
   instant  somehow  both seemed relieved

much pain  well  much danger averted Under  circumstances 
agreed   questioning look  answer  finger  lip 
preserve silence   suspicions until

resolutely before   learn anything  last  answer came

  see nothing   still    waves lapping   
steady swirl  water softly running against  hawser   hear
mens voices calling near  far   roll  creak  oars 
 rowlocks  gun  fired somewhere  echo   seems far away
  tramping  feet overhead  ropes  chains  dragged
along       gleam  light   feel  air
blowing upon 

Here  stopped   risen   impulsively    lay
  sofa  raised both  hands palms upwards   lifting 
weight Van Helsing   looked  each   understanding
Quincey raised  eyebrows slightly  looked   intently whilst
Harkers hand instinctively closed round  hilt   Kukri 
  long pause   knew   time    speak

  time   learn more  Mrs Harker

Early  morning  listened  breathless anxiety  
response   trance  hypnotic stage  even longer  coming
 before    came  time remaining until full sunrise 
 short   began  despair Van Helsing seemed  throw  whole
soul   effort  last  obedience     made

hypnotic messages  Mrs Harker   both  possibly throw
more light    happening

                                   

LaterSunset  come  gone Fortunately  came   time 
   distraction    occurred whilst    
station     secured  necessary calm  isolation
Mrs Harker yielded   hypnotic influence even less readily 
 morning    fear   power  reading  Counts
sensations  die away    want    seems   
 imagination  beginning  work Whilst      trance
hitherto   confined herself   simplest  facts   goes
   ultimately mislead    thought   Counts power
over   die away equally   power  knowledge

Something  going out   feel  pass    cold wind

shudder ran through  increasing  intensity   few seconds
till   end  shook  though   palsy    more even
 answer   Professors imperative questioning   woke 
 trance   cold  exhausted  languid   mind

 October   mWe  near Galatz now      time

Knowing   increasing difficulty  procuring  hypnotic trance
Van Helsing began  passes earlier  usual  produced 
effect  until  regular time   yielded   still
greater difficulty   minute before  sun rose  Professor
lost  time   questioning  answer came  equal quickness

  dark  hear water swirling  level   ears  
creaking  wood  wood Cattle low far    another sound 
queer one   stopped  grew white  whiter still

Go  go  Speak  command   Van Helsing   agonised
voice   same time   despair   eyes   risen sun

 started    sweetly  seemingly   utmost
unconcern

Oh Professor  ask      know  cant  dont remember
anything  seeing  look  amazement   faces  
turning  one      troubled look

       done  know nothing    
lying here half asleep  heard   go  speak  command

Mina Harkers Journal

 NovemberIt  late   afternoon   Professor  
took  way towards  east whence  knew Jonathan  coming  
 go fast though  way  steeply downhill     take
heavy rugs  wraps    dared  face  possibility  being
left without warmth   cold   snow    take   
provisions       perfect desolation   far  
 see through  snowfall    even  sign 
habitation    gone   mile   tired   heavy
walking  sat down  rest   looked back  saw  
clear line  Draculas castle cut  sky     deep under
 hill whereon   set   angle  perspective  
Carpathian mountains  far below   saw     grandeur
perched  thousand feet   summit   sheer precipice  
seemingly  great gap between    steep   adjacent mountain
  side   something wild  uncanny   place 
 hear  distant howling  wolves   far   
sound even though coming muffled through  deadening snowfall 
full  terror  knew   way Dr Van Helsing  searching 
   trying  seek  strategic point     less
exposed  case  attack  rough roadway still led downwards 
 trace  through  drifted snow

  little   Professor signalled      up  joined

Look Madam Mina look look  sprang up  stood beside   
rock  handed   glasses  pointed  snow  now falling
more heavily  swirled  fiercely   high wind  beginning
 blow    times    pauses between 
snow flurries    see  long way round   height  
   possible  see  great distance  far  beyond 
white waste  snow   see  river lying   black ribbon 
kinks  curls   wound  way Straight  front     far
offin fact  near   wondered    noticed beforecame 
group  mounted men hurrying along   midst     cart

      instant later  saw  below  Round
 rock   drawn  circle such    found shelter  last
night    completed   stood beside  again saying

See    come quickly   flogging  horses 
galloping  hard     paused  went    hollow
voice

  racing   sunset     late Gods  
done Down came another blinding rush  driving snow   whole
landscape  blotted out  soon passed   once more 
glasses  fixed   plain  came  sudden cry

Look Look Look See two horsemen follow fast coming up  
south    Quincey  John Take  glass Look before  snow

opening   shelter    converging    
time comes  shall  gypsies   sides   out  revolver
ready  hand  whilst   speaking  howling  wolves came
louder  closer   snow storm abated  moment  looked again
  strange  see  snow falling  such heavy flakes close  
 beyond  sun shining more  more brightly   sank down
towards  far mountain tops Sweeping  glass  around   
see here   dots moving singly   twos  threes  larger
numbersthe wolves  gathering   prey

 instant seemed  age whilst  waited  wind came now 
fierce bursts   snow  driven  fury   swept upon  
circling eddies  times    see  arms length before

clear  airspace around      see afar    
late   accustomed  watch  sunrise  sunset   knew
 fair accuracy       knew  before long 
sun  set   hard  believe    watches   less
  hour   waited   rocky shelter before  various
bodies began  converge close upon   wind came now  fiercer
 more bitter sweeps  more steadily   north  seemingly
 driven  snow clouds      occasional bursts
 snow fell   distinguish clearly  individuals  each
party  pursued   pursuers Strangely enough those pursued 
 seem  realise     care    pursued 
seemed   hasten  redoubled speed   sun dropped lower
 lower   mountain tops

Closer  closer  drew  Professor   crouched down behind
 rock  held  weapons ready   see    determined

horse   centaur waved  back    fierce voice gave  
companions  word  proceed  lashed  horses  sprang
forward   four men raised  Winchester rifles   
unmistakable way commanded   stop   same moment Dr Van
Helsing   rose behind  rock  pointed  weapons  
Seeing    surrounded  men tightened  reins  drew

 dashed towards  cart    felt terrible fear  seeing
Jonathan  such danger    ardour  battle   
upon   well   rest    felt  fear    wild
surging desire   something Seeing  quick movement

  midst     see  Jonathan  one side   ring
 men  Quincey     forcing  way   cart  
evident    bent  finishing  task before  sun
 set Nothing seemed  stop  even  hinder   
levelled weapons   flashing knives   gypsies  front 
 howling   wolves behind appeared  even attract 
attention Jonathans impetuosity   manifest singleness  
purpose seemed  overawe those  front   instinctively 
cowered aside    pass   instant   jumped upon 
cart    strength  seemed incredible raised  great
box  flung  over  wheel   ground   meantime Mr
Morris    use force  pass through  side   ring 
Szgany   time    breathlessly watching Jonathan  
  tail   eye seen  pressing desperately forward  
seen  knives   gypsies flash   won  way through  
 cut     parried   great bowie knife   first
 thought     come through  safety    sprang
beside Jonathan    now jumped   cart   see

spurting through  fingers    delay notwithstanding  
 Jonathan  desperate energy attacked one end   chest
attempting  prize   lid   great Kukri knife  attacked
  frantically   bowie Under  efforts  both men 
lid began  yield  nails drew   quick screeching sound 
 top   box  thrown back

  time  gypsies seeing themselves covered   Winchesters
   mercy  Lord Godalming  Dr Seward  given   made
 resistance  sun   down   mountain tops  
shadows   whole group fell long upon  snow  saw  Count
lying within  box upon  earth     rude falling 
 cart  scattered over    deathly pale    waxen
image   red eyes glared   horrible vindictive look  
knew  well

  looked  eyes saw  sinking sun   look  hate  
turned  triumph

   instant came  sweep  flash  Jonathans great knife
 shrieked   saw  shear through  throat whilst   same
moment Mr Morriss bowie knife plunged   heart

    miracle  before  very eyes    
drawing   breath  whole body crumble  dust  passed 
 sight

 shall  glad  long   live  even   moment  final
dissolution     face  look  peace such   never
  imagined   rested 

 Castle  Dracula now stood out against  red sky   stone
  broken battlements  articulated against  light  
setting sun

 gypsies taking     way  cause   extraordinary
disappearance   dead man turned without  word  rode away 
   lives Those   unmounted jumped upon 
leiterwagon  shouted   horsemen   desert   wolves
  withdrawn   safe distance followed   wake leaving
 alone

Mr Morris   sunk   ground leaned   elbow holding 
hand pressed   side  blood still gushed through  fingers 
flew     Holy circle   now keep  back   
two doctors Jonathan knelt behind    wounded man laid back 
head   shoulder   sigh  took   feeble effort  hand
       unstained    seen  anguish 
 heart   face   smiled    

    happy      service Oh God  cried
suddenly struggling up   sitting posture  pointing    
worth    die Look look

 sun  now right down upon  mountain top   red gleams
fell upon  face     bathed  rosy light  one impulse
 men sank   knees   deep  earnest Amen broke  
  eyes followed  pointing   finger  dying man
spoke

Now God  thanked       vain See  snow  
more stainless   forehead  curse  passed away

   bitter grief   smile   silence  died 
gallant gentleman
