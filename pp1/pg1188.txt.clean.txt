Lady Arabella sat  before  Edgar Caswalls right hand   
certainly  striking  unusual woman     seemed fitting 
 rank  personal qualities      chosen partner 
 heir   first appearance   course nothing   openly 
those    class   present  words   necessary
  much   expressed  nods  smiles   seemed   
accepted thing   last      mistress  Castra Regis
    present amongst      lacking  
whilst admitting   charm  beauty placed    second rank
Lilla Watford being marked  first    sufficient divergence 
type  well   individual beauty  allow  fair comment Lady
Arabella represented  aristocratic type  Lilla   
commonalty

  dusk began  thicken Mr Salton  Sir Nathaniel walked
homethe trap   sent away early   dayleaving Adam

upset  something     elders made  comment   
lit cigarettes   dinnertime  close  hand went

  long  wait   sitting down  standing up several times
Adam suddenly burst out

 outburst   itself enlightening   thwarted affection 
 guise  produce  feeling   amiable young man  Sir
Nathaniel   old diplomatist   way  understanding

   Lilla

Yes   fellow didnt lose  time     soon

  hardly explain        looked   hawk

   came  soft voice  Sir Nathaniel

Adam went 

Perhaps  early Roman look   set      wanted 
protect   seemed  danger

 hope both  young men  keep  heads cool put  Mr Salton

threaten  shall obey  wishes      things

Hush whispered Sir Nathaniel  heard  servants   passage

recent ones

Nothing more   done   moment   separated

Adam  up   early morning  took  smart walk round  Brow

CHAPTER VIIISURVIVALS


 breakfast Sir Nathaniel noticed  Adam  put out  something
   nothing   lesson  silence  better remembered  age
  youth     both   study  Sir Nathaniel
followed  Adam  once began  tell  companion   
happened  Sir Nathaniel looked graver  graver   narration
proceeded   Adam  stopped  remained silent  several
minutes before speaking

  very grave     formed  opinion    seems 
  first impression    worse  anything   expected

 sir  Adam    killing   mongooseno matter 
whomso serious  thing   

 companion smoked  quietly  quite another few minutes before 
spoke

   properly thought  over   moderate  opinion  
 meantime  seems      something dreadful behind 
thissomething   affect   livesthat  mean  issue 
life  death    

Adam sat up quickly

 tell  sir     mindif  course   
objection    think  better  withhold 

   objection Adamin fact        overcome
   fear     more reserved thoughts between 

Indeed sir  sounds serious worse  serious

Adam  greatly fear   time  come  usfor    
 eventsto speak out plainly  one another     seem
something very mysterious  

  thought  sir  along    difficulty one   
one   think    begin

  begin     told   First take  conduct  
mongoose    quiet even friendly  affectionate    
 attacked  snakes      business  life

  

   try  find  reason   attacked Lady Arabella

      mongoose   merely  instinct  attack
 nature   allow  provide    fine reasoning powers
 discriminate     attack

 course          hand    satisfy
ourselves    wish  attack anything    centuries 
particular animal  known  attack  one kind   animal 
  justified  assuming   one   attacks  hitherto
unclassed animal  recognises   animal  quality   
 common   hereditary enemy

   good argument sir Adam went    dangerous one  
 followed  out   lead   believe  Lady Arabella  
snake

   sure before going  such  end     point 
 unconsidered   account   unknown thing  puzzles


  way

Well suppose  instinct works   physical basisfor instance
smell     anything  recent juxtaposition   attacked
  carry  scent surely   supply  missing cause

 course Adam spoke  conviction

Now    tell   negro   come   direction
 Dianas Grove carrying  dead snakes   mongoose  killed
 previous morning     scent   carried  way

 course    probably    never thought    
  possible way  guessing approximately  long  scent 
remain   see    natural scent   derive   place
    effective  thousands  years     scent
  kind carry    form  quality  another kind 
good  evil   ask   one ancient name   house lived 
  lady   attacked   mongoose   Lair   White
Worm      things    difficulties  multiplied
indefinitely    even change  kind      moral
entanglements before  know       midst   struggle
between good  evil

Sir Nathaniel smiled gravely

 regard   first questionso far   know    fixed
periods    scent   activeI think   take   
period   run  thousands  years    whether  moral
change accompanies  physical one        met 
proof   fact    same time   remember  good 
evil  terms  wide   take   whole scheme  creation 
   implied      mutual action  reaction
Generally       scheme   First Cause anything 
possible   long   inherent forces  tendencies   one thing
 veiled     expect mystery

  one  question       ask  opinion
Suppose     permanent forces appertaining   past
   call survivals   belong  good  well   evil
 instance   scent   primaeval monster   remain 
proportion   original strength   same  true  things 
good import

Sir Nathaniel thought    before  answered

   careful   confuse  physical   moral    see
 already   switched   moral entirely  perhaps  
better follow  up first    side   moral   certain
justification  belief   utterances  revealed religion  
instance  effectual fervent prayer   righteous man availeth much
 altogether  good    nothing   similar kind   side 
evil     accept  dictum  need   more fear 
mysteries  become thenceforth merely obstacles

Adam suddenly changed  another phase   subject

 now sir   turn   few minutes  purely practical things
   matters  historical fact

Sir Nathaniel bowed acquiescence

  already spoken   history  far    known   
 places round usCastra Regis Dianas Grove   Lair 
 White Worm      ask    anything 
necessarily  evil import     places

 asked Sir Nathaniel shrewdly

Well  instance  house  Mercy Farm

Thank  sir  Adam earnestly   silent  Sir Nathaniel

 lunch  day Adam casually asked Sir Nathaniel  come  
walk     keenwitted old diplomatist guessed   
  motive behind  suggestion    once agreed

 soon    free  observation Adam began

Gripped  round  throat        dog

Adams companion remained silent   time deep  thought

Adam  boy    last  matter appears     far

Adam nodded

especially  regards Lady Arabella   ready  act promptly

Adam agreed   two men returned  Lesser Hill

CHAPTER XTHE KITE


  following day  little  four oclock Adam set out

Now  Sir Nathaniel  settled down  listen looking  Adam

Mr Caswalls efforts  staring became intensified  poor Lillas
nervousness grew greater  Mimi seeing   cousin  distressed
came close      comfort  strengthen   
consciousness   presence   evidently made  difficulty  Mr
Caswall   efforts without appearing   feebler seemed less
effective   continued   little    gain  both Lilla

 now Mr Caswalls face  lost  appearance  passivity  
eyes glowed   fiery light    still  old Roman 
inflexibility  purpose  grafted    Roman   new Berserker
fury   companions   baleful work seemed   taken 
something   feeling  Lady Arabella looked   soulless pitiless

blenched  knuckles   face suddenly flamed    divine light

Lifting  right hand  stepped forward towards Caswall   
bold sweep   arm seemed  drive  strange force towards 
Again  again   gesture repeated  man falling back  
 each movement  Towards  door  retreated  following  
  sound    cooing sob  doves  seemed  multiply 
intensify  each second   sound   unseen source rose 
rose   retreated till finally  swelled out   triumphant peal
    fierce sweep   arm seemed  hurl something  
foe   moving  hands blindly before  face appeared  
swept through  doorway  out   open sunlight

  once   faculties  fully restored   see  hear

figures   baleful group   though dimly seen  through 
veila shadowy veil   saw Lilla sink down   swoon  Mimi throw
up  arms   gesture  triumph    saw  through  great
window  sunshine flooded  landscape   
momentarily becoming eclipsed   onrush   myriad birds

  next morning daylight showed  actual danger  threatened

 enormous immigration  birds  Experts  sendingon

 reports closer  home  even more disturbing   day long

Doubtless many  going  well  coming   mass seemed never

seeking   whirring  wings never ceased  lessened   air

CHAPTER XIMESMERS CHEST


  couple  weeks  passed  kite seemed  give Edgar Caswall
 new zest  life    never tired  looking   movements  
  comfortable armchair put out   tower wherein  sat sometimes
 day long watching  though  kite   new toy    child
lately come  possession       seem   lost interest
 Lilla   still paid  occasional visit  Mercy Farm

Indeed  feeling towards  whatever     first  now
 far changed    become  distinct affection   purely animal
kind  Indeed  seemed  though  mans nature  become corrupted
    baser  more selfish  more reckless qualities 
become more conspicuous      much sternness apparent  
nature    less selfrestraint  Determination  become
indifference

 visible change  Edgar    grew morbid sad silent 
neighbours thought   going mad   became absorbed   kite 
watched     day    night long   became 
obsession  

Caswall took  personal interest   keeping   great kite flying
   vast coil  cord efficient   purpose  worked  
roller fixed   parapet   tower     winch

 times  kite rose   enormous height  well  travelling 
great distances laterally   fact  kite became   short time
one   curiosities  Castra Regis   around   Edgar began 
attribute      mind  human qualities   became 
  separate entity   mind   soul     Being idle

  early days   amusement Edgar Caswall spent hours  Hundreds
 such messengers flew along  string until soon  bethought  
writing messages   papers     make known  ideas

    fascination  Oolanga goes without saying    never
tired  visiting  museum   tower  spent endless hours 
inspecting  exhibits till   thoroughly familiar

CHAPTER XXMETABOLISM


  looking grave asked Sir Nathaniel inconsequently

nothing  terrifying   seem   suppose    take  exact
  detail  account    strange things  happened
whilst    Dianas Grove

Absolutely certain sir otherwise    gone  
assistance

    account   happened   eyewitness  
trustthat  yourself     another account written  Lady
Arabella under   hand   two accounts   agree  Therefore
  take   one   two  lying

Before  spoke again Sir Nathaniel  made up  mind

Sir Nathaniel nodded  approval




CHAPTER XXIGREEN LIGHT


 old Mr Salton  retired   night Adam  Sir Nathaniel
returned   study  Things went  great regularity  Lesser Hill

 seems   sir      exceedingly tight place

  sobut being feminine   probably overreach herself
Now Adam  strikes       protect ourselves  others
against feminine nature  strong game    play  masculine

  both turned 

Adam knocked  Sir Nathaniels door   grey   morning

Sir Nathaniel shivered perceptibly

Adam noticed   now   friend never spoke  Lady Arabella

Sir Nathaniel switched   electric light    room

Sir Nathaniel held up  expostulatory hand

Good God lad    suggesting  Think   wife

afresh   time both  positive  negative causes

contests whereas  man though unaided  before   Lady

Edgar saw  relaxing   muscles  face  brow

 powerful stimulant  Through  wide window  saw Lady Arabella
enter  plain gateway   farm  advance towards  hall door

eyes flashed    instant  felt  though  new life 
suddenly developed within   Lady Arabellas entry   usual
unconcerned haughty supercilious way heightened  effect  
  two stood close  each  battle  joined  Mr Caswall

sank down   floor

 bed saw little  Adam Salton   remainder   night  
 Mimi walked hand  hand   brightening dawn round   Brow 
Castra Regis    Lesser Hill     deliberately  
attempt  think  little  possible   terrible experiences  
night   morning  bright  cheerful   morning sometimes 
  devastating storm   clouds     plenty 
evidence brought  lingering idea  gloom   nature  bright 
joyous being  striking contrast   scenes  wreck 
devastation  effects  obliterating fire  lasting ruin

  evidence   once stately pile  Castra Regis  
inhabitants   shapeless huddle  shattered architecture dimly seen
  keen breeze swept aside  cloud  acrid smoke  marked 
site   once lordly castle    Dianas Grove  looked 
vain   sign    suggestion  permanence   oak trees 
 Grove  still   seensome  thememerging   haze 
smoke  great trunks solid  erect     larger branches
broken  twisted  rent  bark stripped  chipped  
smaller branches broken  dishevelled looking   constant stress
 threshing   storm

  house  such   even   short distance  
 looked  trace  Adam resolutely turned  back  
devastation  hurried   Mimi    upset  shocked  many
ways    physically dog tired  falling asleep   feet
Adam took    room  made  undress    bed taking
care   room  well lighted both  sunshine  lamps   
obstruction    silk curtain drawn   window  keep out
 glare   sat beside  holding  hand well knowing  
comfort   presence   best restorative     stayed 
 till sleep  overmastered  wearied body    went softly
away   found  uncle  Sir Nathaniel   study having  early
cup  tea amplified   dimensions   possible breakfast  Adam
explained     told  wife    going over 
horrible places again lest   frighten    rest 
sleep  ignorance  help   make  gap  peacefulness between
 horrors

Sir Nathaniel agreed

 know  boy     unfortunate Lady Arabella  dead
   foul carcase   Worm   torn  piecespray God
  evil soul  never more escape   nethermost hell

 visited Dianas Grove first      nearer 
     place   description  required 
Adam felt    tell  story best   spot   absolute
destruction   place  everything   seen   broad daylight
  inconceivable   Sir Nathaniel     story  horror
full  complete    Adam         fringes
 knew   still   seen   friends   over 
knowledge  externals       seen  outside  
houseor    outside   house once    
great horror lay within   ageand  experience  agecounts

 strange  elemental change   aspect  taken place  
time   elapsed   dawn     seem   Nature
herself  tried  obliterate  evil signs    occurred
True  utter ruin   house  made even more manifest  
searching daylight   more appalling destruction  lay beneath
  visible   rent torn  dislocated stonework looked worse
 before  upheaved foundations  piledup fragments  masonry
 fissures   torn earthall    worst   Worms hole
 still evident  round fissure seemingly leading down   very
bowels   earth     horrid mass  blood  slime 
torn evilsmelling flesh   sickening remnants  violent death
 gone      later explosions  thrown up  
deep quantities  water  though foul  corrupt itself  still
 cleansing power left    writhing mass  stirred 
far below  helped  drag down  obliterate  items  horror  
grey dust partly  fine sand partly   waste   falling ruin
covered everything  though ghastly itself helped  mask something
still worse

  few minutes  watching  became apparent   three men 
 turmoil far below    ceased   short irregular intervals
 hellbroth   hole seemed   boiling up   rose  fell
again  turned over showing  fresh form much   nauseous detail
   visible earlier   worst parts   great masses 
 flesh   monstrous Worm    red  sickening aspect
Such fragments   bad enough before  now   infinitely
worse  Corruption comes  startling rapidity  beings whose
destruction   due wholly   part  lightningthe whole mass
seemed   become   once corrupt   whole surface  
fragments once alive  covered  insects worms  vermin  
kinds   sight  horrible enough    awful smell added
 simply unbearable   Worms hole appeared  breathe forth death
   repulsive forms   friends  one impulse moved  
top   Brow   fresh breeze   sea  blowing up

  top   Brow beneath    looked down  saw 
shining mass  white  looked strangely out  place amongst such
wreckage     viewing   appeared  strange  Adam
suggested trying  find  way down     see  more
closely

 need  go down  know    Sir Nathaniel   
explosions  last night  blown   outside   cliffsthat
  see   vast bed  china clay through   Worm
originally found  way down   lair    catch  glint  
water   deep quags far down below  Well  ladyship didnt
deserve such  funeralor such  monument

    

 horrors   last few hours  played such havoc  Mimis
nerves   change  scene  imperativeif  permanent breakdown
   avoided

 think  old Mr Salton   quite time  young people
departed   honeymoon  yours     twinkle   eye 
 spoke

Mimis soft shy glance   stalwart husband  sufficient answer
