 compassed round   very thick fog   accordingly lay 
hoping   change  take place   atmosphere  weather

 two oclock  mist cleared away   beheld stretched out
  direction vast  irregular plains  ice  seemed 
  end     comrades groaned    mind began 
grow watchful  anxious thoughts   strange sight suddenly
attracted  attention  diverted  solicitude   
situation   perceived  low carriage fixed   sledge  drawn 
dogs pass  towards  north   distance  half  mile 
being    shape   man  apparently  gigantic stature
sat   sledge  guided  dogs   watched  rapid progress
  traveller   telescopes until   lost  
distant inequalities   ice   appearance excited 
unqualified wonder      believed many hundred miles

 lay  until  morning fearing  encounter   dark
those large loose masses  float    breaking up  
ice   profited   time  rest   few hours

  morning   soon    light  went upon deck 
found   sailors busy  one side   vessel apparently

Upon hearing   appeared satisfied  consented  come  board
Good God  Margaret    seen  man  thus capitulated

trifling service  whole countenance  lighted up    
 beam  benevolence  sweetness   never saw equalled   
 generally melancholy  despairing  sometimes  gnashes 
teeth   impatient   weight  woes  oppresses 

  guest   little recovered   great trouble  keep 
 men  wished  ask   thousand questions    
allow    tormented   idle curiosity   state  body
 mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose
Once   lieutenant asked    come  far upon  ice
  strange  vehicle

 countenance instantly assumed  aspect   deepest gloom 
 replied  seek one  fled

people     considerate  make inquiries

Certainly   indeed  very impertinent  inhuman

Continuing thus  came  length opposite   inn   
various diligences  carriages usually stopped  Here  paused

   standing    door being opened  perceived Henry
Clerval   seeing  instantly sprung out   
Frankenstein exclaimed   glad    see    fortunate
    here   very moment   alighting

Nothing  equal  delight  seeing Clerval  presence brought
back   thoughts  father Elizabeth   those scenes  home
    recollection   grasped  hand    moment forgot
 horror  misfortune  felt suddenly    first time
during many months calm  serene joy   welcomed  friend
therefore    cordial manner   walked towards

Very well  very happy   little uneasy   hear

Entreating  therefore  remain  few minutes   bottom  
stairs  darted up towards   room   hand  already  
lock   door before  recollected myself    paused  
cold shivering came over    threw  door forcibly open 
children  accustomed     expect  spectre  stand 
waiting      side  nothing appeared   stepped
fearfully    apartment  empty   bedroom   freed

fortune   befallen     became assured   enemy
 indeed fled  clapped  hands  joy  ran down  Clerval

 ascended   room   servant presently brought breakfast
   unable  contain myself     joy   possessed
  felt  flesh tingle  excess  sensitiveness   pulse
beat rapidly    unable  remain   single instant   same
place  jumped over  chairs clapped  hands  laughed aloud
Clerval  first attributed  unusual spirits  joy   arrival

Oh save   Save    imagined   monster seized

Poor Clerval       feelings   meeting  
anticipated  such joy  strangely turned  bitterness

action    towards

unremitting attentions   friend   restored   life
 form   monster     bestowed existence  forever
before  eyes   raved incessantly concerning   Doubtless 
words surprised Henry   first believed     wanderings

cheerful  before   attacked   fatal passion

Dearest Clerval exclaimed   kind  very good

Great God    one instant   thought     hellish

forever   native country  wandered  friendless outcast over
 earth   consented   miserable marriage    
possessed  magic powers  monster  blinded    real

 concealed  feelings   appearance  hilarity  brought
smiles  joy   countenance   father  hardly deceived 
everwatchful  nicer eye  Elizabeth   looked forward

constantly        watch  prevent artifice 
  means gained  greater degree  tranquillity  Indeed  
period approached  threat appeared more   delusion   
regarded  worthy  disturb  peace   happiness  hoped 
  marriage wore  greater appearance  certainty   day fixed
  solemnization drew nearer   heard  continually spoken 
  occurrence   accident  possibly prevent

Elizabeth seemed happy  tranquil demeanour contributed greatly 
calm  mind     day    fulfil  wishes  
destiny   melancholy   presentiment  evil pervaded 
 perhaps   thought   dreadful secret   
promised  reveal     following day   father   
meantime overjoyed    bustle  preparation  recognized 
 melancholy   niece  diffidence   bride

  ceremony  performed  large party assembled  
fathers    agreed  Elizabeth    commence 
journey  water sleeping  night  Evian  continuing 
voyage   following day   day  fair  wind favourable
 smiled   nuptial embarkation

Those   last moments   life during   enjoyed 
feeling  happiness   passed rapidly along  sun  hot  
 sheltered   rays   kind  canopy   enjoyed 
beauty   scene sometimes  one side   lake   saw
Mont Saleve  pleasant banks  Montalegre    distance
surmounting   beautiful Mont Blanc   assemblage  snowy
mountains   vain endeavour  emulate  sometimes coasting 
opposite banks  saw  mighty Jura opposing  dark side  
ambition   quit  native country   
insurmountable barrier   invader   wish  enslave 

 took  hand  Elizabeth    sorrowful  love  Ah  
 knew    suffered      endure  
endeavour    taste  quiet  freedom  despair  
one day   permits   enjoy

 happy   Victor replied Elizabeth    hope
nothing  distress    assured    lively joy  
painted   face  heart  contented  Something whispers  
  depend  much   prospect   opened before   
  listen  such  sinister voice  Observe  fast  move
along    clouds  sometimes obscure  sometimes rise
above  dome  Mont Blanc render  scene  beauty still more
interesting  Look    innumerable fish   swimming 
 clear waters    distinguish  pebble  lies 
 bottom    divine day   happy  serene  nature
appears

Thus Elizabeth endeavoured  divert  thoughts  mine  
reflection upon melancholy subjects    temper  fluctuating
joy   few instants shone   eyes   continually gave place
 distraction  reverie

 sun sank lower   heavens  passed  river Drance 
observed  path through  chasms   higher   glens

  prey  feelings unsatisfied  unquenched    dead 
called   being    shall   more  very remembrance
  both  speedily vanish   shall  longer see  sun 
stars  feel  winds play   cheeks

Light feeling  sense  pass away    condition  
find  happiness   years ago   images   world
affords first opened upon    felt  cheering warmth  summer
 heard  rustling   leaves   warbling   birds 
        wept  die now    
consolation  Polluted  crimes  torn   bitterest remorse
   find rest   death

Farewell   leave      last  humankind  
eyes   behold Farewell Frankenstein  thou wert  alive
  cherished  desire  revenge against     better
satiated   life    destruction      thou
didst seek  extinction     cause greater wretchedness
     mode unknown   thou hadst  ceased  think
 feel thou wouldst  desire against   vengeance greater 
   feel Blasted  thou wert  agony  still superior 
thine   bitter sting  remorse   cease  rankle  
wounds until death shall close  forever

 soon  cried  sad  solemn enthusiasm  shall die 
  now feel   longer felt  Soon  burning miseries  
extinct   shall ascend  funeral pile triumphantly  exult  
agony   torturing flames  light   conflagration 
fade away  ashes   swept   sea   winds   spirit
 sleep  peace    thinks    surely think thus
Farewell

 lay close   vessel    soon borne away   waves 
lost  darkness  distance
